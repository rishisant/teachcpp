### How To Debug Your Code / Looking For Outputs
1. You can debug your code through looking at console output by doing the following:
```sh
cd <insert directory of module here>
make
./name_of_module <params>
```
For example, in __Module 2: Functions Pt. 1__, assuming you are within the folder directory, run the following commands (specified in the driver.cpp file):
```sh
make
./driver <-min or -max> <-v1 or -v2 or -v3 or -v4 or -v5>
```

### How To Test Your Code
1. You can test code by running the following commands within your shell:
```sh
cd <insert directory of module here>
make test
